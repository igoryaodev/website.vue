  "p1": "Ullens Center for Contemporary Art (UCCA) is the international institution at the heart of Beijing’s 798 Art District. Each year it presents a wide range of exhibitions and educational programs, highlighting artists from China and beyond, and encouraging the public to engage with contemporary art and culture. Opened in 2007, UCCA is a non-profit, non-collecting, non-governmental museum sustained by the generosity of numerous patrons, sponsors, members, and visitors, beginning with founders Guy and Myriam Ullens. In everything it does, UCCA aims to elaborate an inclusive, cosmopolitan vision of China in the world.",
  "p2": "UCCA founders Baron and Baroness Guy and Myriam Ullens de Schooten are among the world’s leading art collectors. Their deep affection for China led them to build one of the world’s most comprehensive collections of Chinese art, and in turn an art center that would promote the development of this art.  Having retired from a forty-year career with his family’s business in 2000, Mr. Ullens devotes his full energies to charitable initiatives. Together they also maintain a series of projects in Nepal including orphanages, child-nutrition centers, and the Ullens School. In 2004, Mrs. Ullens founded the Mimi Foundation, which helps to ease the suffering of cancer patients at hospitals throughout Europe.",
